# Gitleaks ignore file
# Test files contain legitimate test fixtures that should not trigger secret scanning
# Note: Gitleaks doesn't support glob patterns, use specific file paths or inline comments

# Test fixtures and test data - use inline # gitleaks:allow comments in test files
# For reference, test files are in:
# - packages/core/tests/
# - packages/proxy/tests/
# - docs/examples/

# Documentation examples (these are intentionally fake keys for demonstration)
# Use inline # gitleaks:allow comments in documentation files
